      <p>
        Most dads want more time with their sons but real life gets loud—work, school, sports, and endless
        notifications. Before you know it, the years that matter most have slipped by.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trip is a <strong>holy interruption</strong>: seven days shoulder-to-shoulder instead of just
        catching up across the dinner table, shared challenge that naturally opens the door for real
        conversations, and a setting that pulls you into a story you’re writing together.

        Every week is a little different based on weather and the group, but here’s a snapshot of what a
        father–son sailing adventure can look like.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Day 1 – Welcome Aboard (Tortola)</h3>
          <p>
            Board your catamaran, get settled into your cabin, and meet the other dads and sons. Safety
            briefing and intro to sailing basics.

          <p>
            Explore the giant boulders and hidden pools at The Baths, then snorkel in clear water and grab
            beach time together.

          <h3>Day 3 – Island Hopping &amp; Kayak Races</h3>
          <p>
            Learn more about sailing, take the helm, and join kayak or paddleboard races between boats.
            Watch the sunset from the trampoline and stargaze from the bow.
          </p>

          <h3>Day 4 – Anegada Adventure &amp; Setup for Treasure Hunt</h3>
          <p>
            Long blue-water sail to Anegada. Beach time, optional fishing, and lobster on the beach.

            Deep-water sail with a nautical treasure hunt. Use charts, bearings, and GPS clues to uncover
            “hidden” spots like the cannons off Saba. Knot-tying challenges where each knot mastered
            unlocks another clue.
          </p>

          <h3>Day 6 – Bioluminescent Swim &amp; Beach Fire</h3>
          <p>
            Snorkeling and beach time during the day. At night (conditions allowing), slip into glowing
            water for a bioluminescent swim, followed by a beach fire.

      <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What age range is this for?</h3>
        <p>
          Generally, we recommend sons from age 11–18. If your son is slightly younger or older, let’s
          talk. The key is that both of you are ready to engage, help on the boat, and participate in group
          activities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need sailing experience?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Many dads and sons come with zero sailing background. Our skippers handle the hard stuff and
          happily teach anyone who wants to learn.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this a Christian trip?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We openly center our week on following Jesus. You can expect daily Scripture, prayer,
          worship, and honest conversations about faith—without pressure or performance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I get seasick?</h3>
        <p>
          The BVI are known for relatively calm, protected waters and short hops between islands. We still
          recommend bringing motion sickness remedies that work for you, and we’ll talk through best
          practices before you come.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What’s the payment and refund policy?</h3>
        <p>
          We’ll review specific terms before you register, including deposit amounts, final payment due
          dates, and refund timelines if plans change or if there are weather or travel disruptions.

        <p>
          <strong>Ty Atteberry</strong> has spent years sailing the British Virgin Islands with friends
          and family, and helping thousands of boaters experience these waters through BoatyBall. He’s a
          husband, dad, entrepreneur, and follower of Jesus who believes some of the best conversations
          happen on the bow of a boat at sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          This father–son sailing adventure was born out of his own desire to create unforgettable,
          faith-shaping experiences with his kids—and to invite other dads and sons into the same kind of
          story.

        You can’t keep one foot on the dock and one in the boat forever. At some point, God nudges you to
        step in, cast off the lines, and trust Him with the journey.
